# Temperature-and-Humidity-Detection
This project demonstrates how to measure temperature and humidity using a DHT11 sensor connected to a NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller. The collected data is sent to the Blynk IoT platform over Wi-Fi, allowing real-time remote monitoring from a mobile app or web dashboard.
